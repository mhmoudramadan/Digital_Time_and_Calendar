## Introduction

Digital Time and Calendar is a project aimed at creating a versatile system for displaying both time and calendar information digitally. The system provides accurate timekeeping functionality along with a calendar display to keep track of dates and events.

## Features

- **Real-time clock**: The system maintains accurate time using an RTC (Real-Time Clock) module.
- **Calendar display**: Users can view the current date, day of the week, and month on the display.
- **Alarm functionality**: Set alarms for specific times to receive notifications.
- **Configurable settings**: Customize settings such as time format, date format, and alarm settings.
